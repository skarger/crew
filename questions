Top priorities before launching:
1. Decide on domain - this is the main blocker.
2. Flesh out sign up pages - what info do we want people to enter?
3. Need CREW email set up (through Google apps?) after determining domain name. We also need a site "Broadcaster" in NationBuilder. BFP has several already but we should have a CREW-specific one.

4. We need to set up a payment processor and adjust Donate page. (Or we can temporarily hide that page if that's a problem.)
        https://betterfutureproject.nationbuilder.com/admin/merchant_accounts/payflows/new
        http://nationbuilder.com/j3_gaming/paypal_payflow_pro_bank_account
5. Logo
6. Slider images (assuming you like that style)
  Hurricane Harvey images
7. Caroline needs to be a control panel user in order to be point person

Outstanding items and questions that do not block launch:

http://crew-betterfutureproject.nationbuilder.com/unsubscribe
http://nationbuilder.com/how_to_use_the_unsubscribe_page
"The page content will be the same across all websites of a nation."

Need bios for Caroline and Craig for the Our Team page. Titles at minimum. Portait pictures taken in the same style would be great.
Up to you if you want additional summary blurbs.

Admin accounts
You two do not necessarily need to adjust the site any time soon - at least it's not a blocker to launch. However one major perk of NationBuilder is that it's quite accessible for you to change content and add features yourselves.
- Craig already is a Nation Builder admin and can edit the site as desired.
- Caroline will need to be added by Craig at the appropriate permission level within the BFP nation in order to edit content/blog etc.

NB has many other features we can add semi out-of-the-box. For example a blog, surveys, event calendar, FAQs, petitions, etc. It will make sense to discuss more after cleaning up the basic site.

Do you want social buttons (Like on Facebook, Tweet this, etc.)?
        I'm curious if BFP has had good results with social links. They create visual clutter but be worth it to help drive traffic.

Add viewable invoices to complement donation page?

Should there be a feedback page? (Could be useful as we don't yet know much about who will engage with the site and their wants/needs.)

Do you want to have a Rules/Code of Conduct page? This would apply more if we have discussion features on the site.
